# CSV-with-JSON-expansion
Jupyter Notebook to process a csv file with one or more json columns

This is a simple jupyter notebook to take in a csv file, identify columns with json, expand those columns, then resave as a new csv.

I had need of analyzing some log files out of Office 365 that were exported to a csv file with a json column, so this was my quick solution to convert it into a tabular format and get the summary statistics I needed.
